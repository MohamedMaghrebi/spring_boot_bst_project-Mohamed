spring_boot_bst_project-Mohamed: 

Semester 4 Final Sprint

Data Structures and Algorithms
 
This project must be completed individually.
Objective: 
Develop a Spring Boot application that allows users to create a binary search tree from a series of numbers, visualize the resulting tree, and view previous tree results. 
Requirements: 
1.	User Input Interface: 
1.	Implement a route (/enter-numbers) that displays an HTML page. 
2.	This page should contain: 
·	An input field for users to enter a series of numbers. 
·	A 'Submit' button to send numbers for processing.  
·	A 'Show Previous' button to view earlier trees stored in the database. 
2.	Processing Route: 
1.	Create a route (/process-numbers) that: 
1.	Accepts the list of numbers from the user input. 
2.	Constructs a binary search tree by inserting the numbers sequentially. 
3.	Returns the tree as a JSON representation. 
4.	Stores both the input numbers and resulting tree structure in a database of your choice. 
3.	Display Previous Trees: 
1.	Implement a route (/previous-trees) that: 
1.	Retrieves and displays the input numbers and their corresponding tree structures from the database. 
4.	Testing: 
1.	Include at least three unit tests for your application. 
5.	Database: 
1.	Store all input numbers and their resulting tree structures in a database of your choice. 
Bonus: 
1.	Return a balanced binary search tree to the user. 
Notes: 
While aesthetic enhancements and additional features (e.g., a homepage) are encouraged, the main goal is to have a functional application with the three described routes. 
Ensure your application provides a clear and user-friendly interface for data entry and results visualization.
